Part A: Using DNS Commands (nslookup)
Step 1: Open Command Prompt
• Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
Step 2: Find IP address of a domain
nslookup www.example.com
• Observe:
o DNS server used (often your ISP’s DNS or local DNS server)
o The resolved IP address
Step 3: Perform a reverse lookup (IP → domain)
nslookup 93.184.216.34

• See the canonical domain name corresponding to the IP.
Step 4: Query different DNS record types (e.g., mail servers)
nslookup -query=MX example.com
• Shows mail exchange servers for the domain.
Part B: DNS Packet Analysis with Wireshark
Step 1: Install and open Wireshark
• Download and install Wireshark.
• Open Wireshark as Administrator.
Step 2: Start capturing packets
• In the Wireshark main window, select your active interface (usually Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
• Click the blue shark fin icon to start capture.
Step 3: Generate DNS traffic
• In Command Prompt, run:
nslookup www.example.com
Step 4: Stop capturing
• Click the red square (Stop) in Wireshark.

Step 5: Filter DNS packets
• In the filter bar at the top of Wireshark, type:
dns
• Press Enter to filter and display only DNS-related packets.

Step 6: Analyze captured packets
• Select the DNS query packet (from your PC to DNS server, usually UDP port 53).
• Expand:
o Transaction ID: used to match request & response
o Flags: standard query, recursion desired, response

o Questions: the domain name queried
• Select the response packet from DNS server:
o Observe the resolved IP address under the Answers section.
